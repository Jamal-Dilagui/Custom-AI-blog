# Lumen Journal — Worklog

---
Task ID: 1-8
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Clone christinebritton.com as a professional, AdSense-friendly editorial blog with a full admin CMS panel.

Work Log:
- Analyzed reference site (personal-name lifestyle blog) and designed an editorial magazine concept ("Lumen Journal") with warm cream/terracotta palette, Playfair Display + Inter typography.
- Designed Prisma schema (User, Category, Post, Comment, SiteSetting, Media, Subscriber) with AdSense fields, SEO fields, and content controls. Pushed to SQLite.
- Built 18 API route handlers: auth (login/logout/me), posts (list/create/get/update/delete/by-slug+view-increment), categories (CRUD), comments (create/list/moderate), settings (get/upsert singleton), media (list/create/delete), upload (multipart image), stats (dashboard aggregates), subscribers (newsletter signup).
- Built auth lib with HMAC-signed httpOnly session cookies and pbkdf2 password hashing.
- Built Zustand navigation store (route + admin view state) and typed API client.
- Built public site shell: sticky header with utility bar, logo, nav, category strip, mobile sheet menu, search dialog; sticky footer with newsletter + social links; theme provider; settings context.
- Built public views: home (hero featured + side featured, trending, categories showcase, editor's pick + sidebar ad, latest grid, in-article ad, newsletter), post reading view (breadcrumb, cover, markdown render, tags, author box, share, comments with form + list, related posts, ads), category view (hero + grid + load more), blog/search view (filters + sort + load more), about view (story + stats + values), contact view (info + form).
- Built AdSlot component: renders labeled placeholders by default, switches to real `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` when a valid AdSense client ID + slot are configured. Placements: header, in-article, sidebar, footer.
- Built full admin panel: login (demo creds), admin shell (collapsible sidebar + mobile nav), dashboard (stat cards, recharts bar chart of posts/category, audience card, most-read list, recent activity), posts manager (filters, featured toggle, status badges, delete confirm), post editor (title/slug/excerpt, cover upload + media library, markdown editor with live preview, tags, publish settings, SEO fields with char counters), categories manager (CRUD with icon/color pickers), media manager (drag-drop upload, grid, copy URL), comments manager (approve/spam/delete), settings manager (tabs: general, branding, about, AdSense, social).
- Generated 8 AI images (6 post covers + author portrait + about) via z-ai image CLI.
- Seeded database: 1 admin user, 6 categories, 6 full-length articles with markdown content, site settings with AdSense placeholders.
- Fixed lint issues: refactored dynamic category-icon rendering into a stable switch-based CategoryIcon component; restructured effects to use active-ref pattern to satisfy react-hooks/set-state-in-effect rule.
- Fixed critical bug: setAdminView was not destructured from useApp in AdminApp (was undefined, silently breaking post-login navigation). Fixed + added auth-state normalization so logged-in users land on the dashboard.

Stage Summary:
- Production-ready editorial blog + CMS on a single `/` route with hash-free state navigation.
- Admin credentials: admin@lumenjournal.com / admin123
- All API routes return 200; ESLint passes clean; no console/runtime errors.
- Verified end-to-end with Agent Browser: home renders with hero/ads/categories, post view renders full markdown, admin login → dashboard with charts, posts list, post editor creates drafts (verified via API), settings AdSense tab works.
- Responsive (mobile header + sheet menu) and sticky-footer layout verified.
- AdSense-ready: clearly labeled ad placeholders in 4 positions, auto-convert to live ads when client/slot IDs are entered in Settings.
